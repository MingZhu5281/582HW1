0,a gave it a    instead of a     awful  because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning  a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork . but that wasn  t enough to save it .  br    br   the  sepia  toned  washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies . nothing new there . i can see there were some hat  tips to other old  classic movies . ok . no problem with that .  br    br   but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting  not something that would put you to sleep .  br    br   the story line and the script of this movie was awful  the characters two dimensional . slow moving . some of the scenes were pretty to look at  but ultimately  as a whole  it was quite boring  i couldn  t recommend it .  
1,the final season of roseanne was a roller coaster ride of crazy . this final episode does just what a previous comment says  it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not . roseanne reaches back to season one  and tells us that this show has been her rendition of her life . she says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit . scott was not really with leon  but he existed . mark and david married opposite wives in real life  and dan died when she made him live . as events happened in her life  she changed them in her writing . don  t we all wish we could do that . don  t we all have a moment in time that we wish we could just use an eraser and change to our liking . this is what she did with the entire episode . and to another comment i would say that i don  t feel cheated  the family was real in my mind  she just changed the way that events happened in their lives . an a ending to an a show      
1,  the man in the moon  is a pretty good movie . it is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects . i wouldn  t say the film was terribly original  but what is these days   br    br   the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles . i really enjoyed seeing reese witherspoon at such a young age  and does quite a good job . jason london does a fine job as well . and the only other person i recognized was sam waterston  who did a fantastic job with his role . i really liked sam  s character  matthew trant  a lot . at times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread  but in the end you really like his character . the rest of the cast was very good as well .  br    br   if you  re into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you  then you ought to watch this film . i  d suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you  d be interested in  then go for it . anyhow  hope you enjoy the film  thanks for reading   br    br    chris  
0,after a day at work  i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels . the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started . the first   minutes were enough to make me interested  but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie . if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting . all in all  don  t plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night .  
0,this movie is similar to darkness falls  and the boogeyman       but it  s also much more graphic than both  and not as good as either . it  s also slow and fairly predictable . it  s also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror . plus  we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational  inspirational sermon . really  this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything . even though it is gory  the makeup effects are not very realistic looking . in fact they look kinda cheap . aside from all that  there is some really awful clichd dialogue . and i won  t say when  but there is a point where a couple of the character  s actions were not authentic or believable  given the circumstances . nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way . once you watch the movie  you  ll know what i mean . there  s also some gratuitous nudity for nudity  s sake . it just wasn  t necessary at all . the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good . better than this movie deserves . so  after carefully weighing the evidence  id say this movie was passable  but not good . my verdict for the tooth fairy      
1,after a chance encounter on the train  a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna  discussing life and love . the primary reason to see  before sunrise   is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines . as  celine   this sexy  brainy  soulful brown  eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid  twenties . risking overstatement  celine is practically the ideal woman  unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural  unpretentious  introspective  and selflessly loving . we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak  for her sincere  intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating . further  her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing .  br    br   if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie  it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar . ethan hawke as  jessie  comes off like a vaguely appealing slob  sort of a maynard g . krebs of the nineties . attempting to appear detached and nonchalant  he sort of drags himself through certain shots . his pants fit poorly  his tee shirt is coming untucked  his wavy dark hair  his most attractive feature  needs a good washing  and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee . nevertheless  he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two  week train ride around europe  so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine . his oft  cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine  although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation . when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence  we know he is getting somewhere .  br    br   after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes  bars  and silly diversions  they agree that because they may never see one another again  they should make the most of it . jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass  looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up .  br    br   given his boundless luck in the romance department  it is especially irksome when jessie  as the very definition of a naive jerk  foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp . he contents himself with a half  baked plan  quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu  to reunite at the same spot in half a year . when the appointed time comes  you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another  perhaps even married and pregnant . for whatever reason  she probably won  t show  while jesse  who ends up working at target or  if he  s lucky  the local library  will go back to vienna  desperate to see her again  only to wind up alone .  br    br   despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion   before sunrise  is a beautiful movie . i highly recommend both it and the sequel   before sunset .   
0,from the start this film was awful  why was it that bad   if it isn  t the naked women  not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of colgate whitening   then it  s the  crazy  old guy at the gas station  who isn  t so much crazy  but more  i  m not sure how to act a great deal so i will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as i can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods    then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis . . . . apparently  without touching you . . . and this is according to the opening scene . . . . they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck  which i assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some tcp to clear it right up . then you have sophie holland who plays ally  i have never seen such baaaaaad acting  she is more of a  me me me  if i  m not having fun no  one else is  and i don  t wanna do this so i won  t  and i  m the meanest cow on the planet  i  m sarcastic  petty and if i don  t get things my way i will sulk    kind of person . . . . reminds me more of a  yr old girl  s attitude . i don  t think it  s even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of blair witch  or how low  budget the film actually was that when judd was hacking at the  locked  door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side   this film is completely laughable  if it were a spoof then it would have been successful . . . only just though  but  as a horror film is was just plain wrong    i can  t even being to describe everything that went t  ts up in this movie i would run out of room  although it was funny to watch andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while tom savini  s character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision   it was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor  which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow  so is it any wonder they don  t get away with it   and how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened  no pain  no weakening from blood loss  nothing   but the silliest part is when all of a sudden  and i mean that literally  it  s one year later and molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs  and then lo and behold  shaun hutson picks her up . . . of course not without a line to promote his books    altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors  but suddenly  and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why . . . she  s evil herself and lures hutson to his death  then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can  even after his  dazzling  performance on why no  one should ever venture there for whatever reason . . . cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while crazy pours petrol everywhere . . . . and here endeth the film . . . . finally  my conclusion . . . . if you hadn  t already guessed by now . . . . absolute rubbish  there was no proper thought went into it at all  whoever was aiming the camera needed firing . . . and come to think of it so did    of the cast  if the right director  actors  and budget got behind this it could have been decent . but  once again  low  budget english horror films but the rest of the genre  the country  and the english film  making industry to shame    and i  m english so i  m allowed to say that   in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first      mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area . all i kept thinking throughout this was  jesus christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this  its absolute cow  s testicles    but i can  t turn a film off after i  ve started watching it unfortunately . i had to watch from dusk til dawn afterwards just to remind myself that tom savini does have it in him to act well  if there was an option for     then believe me i woulda chose that  cuz this film isn  t even worth the one point i did give it   br    br   but this is just my opinion  watch it and decide for yourself .  
1,all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense . as a matter of fact this is the best movie i  ve ever seen . it  s an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best . i would not give criticism to any of the actors . that movie is the best and it will always stay that way .  
1,this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it  s kind . the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen . it treats themes like duty  guilt  word  manipulation and trust like few films have done and  unfortunately  none that i can recall since the death of the  policial  in the late seventies . the sequence is delicious  down to the essential  living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake . no such scenes are present or needed . the argument is sand honest to the spectator an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience . no  this is not miss marble . . . a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute  not just to see .  
1,let me get the bad out of the way first  james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day . really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery .  br    br   that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes . i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september   th . it is a second home to me and i can  t help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city . this is the real deal  in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them . i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day . it is a shame that they didn  t use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory  it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was .  br    br   conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way .
